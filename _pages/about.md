# A Brief History

Like many, my life has always been surrounded by computers. I was certainly
part of a generation that was almost raised by them. The simplicity of a 
well-made user interface on top of the enormous complexity of the hardware truly
fascinated me. I would spend my time not only playing with them but also
exploring vast amounts of software. I eventually ventured into software 
such as Game Maker, wanting to fully create my own game.

In April 2010, I had started to hear about a game called Minecraft. It was in 
a beta development stage at this point and came with the promise of regular
updates to bring it into a full release. I loaded up some videos online and
quickly bought a copy. I quickly fell in love. The simple graphics mixed with 
the fun sandbox world pulled me in. This game still remains my 
all-time favourite, and I go back to it multiple times a year. It's hard to
believe that regular updates for it are still a thing!

I eventually wanted to understand exactly how the game worked. How does the game
generate such vast and randomly generated worlds? How does the light level of
and area dictate what kinds of creatures can spawn?

I once again looked online to understand more about how the game was built. I 
learned that the game was built on a programming language called Java. I loaded
up a YouTube video series on the language and was away! I spent months
combing over the tutorials and eventually bought a more in-depth course
from an online provider. I quickly started to develop my own playful 
applications.

At this point I was getting confident with the language and was ready for my
first serious project. A game. I decided to go with a framework called Slick2D.
To my surprise it was fairly quick to pickup, and I was able to make a clone of 
Pong in a weekend. From here I eventually dived into the LibGDX framework which
offered a wider range of features as well as a growing community.

I spent a large amount of time on developing my own games. I eventually released
a very rudimentary one to the Google Play Store. It was fantastic. From here I ended up switching my focus fully to software development, 
eventually getting my first job and never looking back. 

I truly love software and everything it entails. I never plan to stop doing 
it, and I continue to stride to be the best engineer that I can be.
