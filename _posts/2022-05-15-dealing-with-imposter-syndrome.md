## My Struggle

Imposter syndrome is something that I have personally struggled with a fair amount in my career.
It tends to come in waves. I will sometimes go a year or so with really high confidence 
in my abilities before something big rocks my foundation and causes me to fall
into a deep spiral of self-doubt. This is exactly what has happened in the last couple 
of weeks.

I recently picked up some React work and realised that I didn't have as good as a grasp
as I thought I did. This has caused me to start over-analysing everything I know about
frontend. I have been asking myself if I'm good enough to be deserving of the full stack
and senior software engineer titles. Do I even deserve my job?

These feeling have even started to slip into my backend knowledge, which is scary. 
Backend is where I usually feel most at home. I feel confident wielding the languages 
and tools, leading the way and helping others when they become stuck. Now I'm not sure 
if this is something I should be doing.

When I have had these feelings come up in the past I would frantically start
trying to learn the technology that caused me to feel inferior. It never works.
I would spend hours reading documentation and not retain half of it, which would make 
me feel worse.

## The Action Plan

However, I think I might have finally figured out how I can deal with these thoughts. 
I have broken this into an action plan which contains 3 steps.

* Discover where I believe my weaknesses are
* Learn and retain knowledge of my weaknesses via building of new projects
* Reinforce knowledge in areas I still feel strongly with

Currently, my belief of my poor React knowledge is causing these thoughts of inadequacy. 
I have been re-reading the documentation and this has already helped me tremendously. I 
have so far found very little that I didn't already know, and I'm now working through
the concepts which I feel weak in.

The next step is that I will begin building a new project that is solely focused on
frontend technologies. This will force me to face my weaknesses head on and not spend too
much time with technology that I feel stronger in. For this project I will be using 
React, Tailwind and Jest. Jest is the only technology of these that I have used before,
but I still feel that I can improve with it.

Finally, I am focusing on playing around with the technologies that I feel the most
comfortable with but also throwing in some new concepts. For this I am playing 
around with Laravel and Docker. The new concepts come in with Docker. The various network
types that it provides has been something I have mostly avoided, but I am 
now spending some time making sure I understand networking at it's core and
seeing what Docker can really do

With all of this I'm starting to feel much better. I'm discovering that I know more than 
I do, my confidence is growing everytime I do something, and I feel like I'm going to come
out as a much better engineer.

## Final Thoughts

Some of the best scientists, researchers and engineers in the world suffer with imposter
syndrome. It's completely normal. I have come to realise that I can try and turn imposter
syndrome on it's head. It allows me to realise where my weaknesses are and to work on 
improving my skills as a senior software engineer.
